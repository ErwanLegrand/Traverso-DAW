03-12-2007 Remon Sijrier <remon at traverso-daw dot org>
	* Reworked core and GUI code to work with Universal Sample Rate (TimeRef struct)
	  instead of the samplerate dependend nframes_t
	  This allows Traverso to mix files of different samplerate freely, making
	  the samplerate of the audio as independend as the bitdepth of the audio.
	* Merged MonoReader and ReadSource into ReadSource
	* Audio data is store interleaved on hard disk now, in an attempt to improve
	  hard disk bandwidth, and cpu usage, specially for compressed audio files.
	* Compile Traverso with large file support.
	* Calculate Peak data in a samplerate independend way (using 44.1 KHz as reference)
	* Added a "Restore Backup" solution, which stores the latest 1000 saves. Restoring 
	  a backup from the "Restore from Backup" dialog is very easy and fail save.
	* Auto save after a recording finished, since this this is likely a very important 
	  point in time to create a backup file
	* Added project converter to convert projects from Traverso < 0.42.0 to Traverso 0.42.0
	* Splitted Export/Burn to CD dialog into 2: Export Dialog and Write CD dialog
	* mmap peak data by using Qt 4.4 new mmap function, or if not compiled with Qt 4.4
	  use our own code (which equals that of Qt 4.4)
	* More accurate Peak data calculation, improved and faster Waveform drawing.
	* Sync sse code to Ardour2's one, added Veclib optimizations (apple ppc only)
	  check if processor has denormal as zero capabilities and use it if it's there.
	* Added support to compile Traverso with cmake. qmake still works, but the intention is
	  to move to using cmake exclusively
	* Updated slv2 code to 0.3.0 (svn (7-11-2007)), added option to compile against system installed slv2
	* Adding and removing of audio processing objects is faster and even more Real Time save now.
	* Curve processing (e.g. Gain curve) is much faster now
	* Shuttle tuning.
	* Fixed bug in CD TOC export, sometimes resulting in no audio exported!
	* Added WAV64 is recording format.
	* Added 2 submenus to the Settings Menu:
		- Select recording encoding format, after selection the new recording will be recorded with
		  the selected encoding
		- Select the resample quality, the new quality will be used directly. When changing the quality
		  during playback or recording, a short sillence will occur vs no recording during a small amount
		  of time (the time it takes to seek to the current + 'one buffer time' location)
	* Default to use 3 periods and a period size of 512 frames when using the ALSA driver.
	* Tons of bug fixes, old ones, new ones and various improvements all over the place.


03-12-2007 Nicola Doebelin
	* Created 3 new Themes
	* Updated the User Manual to 0.42.0 and translated to German
	* Updated German translation of the GUI

	  Added support for native reading/writing to:
	  	- FLAC
	  	- Ogg Vorbis
	  	- WavPack
	  	- MP3
	* Created an Resampled Audio reader which is a wrapper for the available
	  reader classes, and applies sample rate conversion on the read data.
	* Created GUI elements to select type and parameters of encoder in the Export Dialog.
	* Improvements and bugs fixes.



05-07-2007 Remon Sijrier <remon at traverso-daw dot org>
	* Released 0.41.0

	* Merged patch from Fernando Lopez (iirc) to make jack > 0.105 work
	* Jack transport control added
	* AudioClip Edit dialog, with improvements from Nicola
	* Reworked external processing dialog, with focus on sox support
	* Slightly more contrast in the default theme.
	* Fixed audible glitch when playing over spitpoint
	* usual amount of bug fixes
	* support for project renaming, detection if project dirs are renamed outside of traverso
	  improved detection if projects dirs are renamed, with tooltip help in open project dialog
	  to be able to restore the project dir name, so the project can be loaded.


09-06-2007 Remon Sijrier <remon at traverso-daw dot org>
	* Released 0.40.0
	
	* Various improvements on the Input Engine
		Added mouse events support
		Cancel hold commands feature added
		Generally improved user experience
		Modifier keys, like in old fashioned 'shortcut' keys
		Modifer keys to be used _during_ a hold action, a list of options 
		can be viewed _during_ the hold action, using either < Q > or right mouse button.
		
	* Command Plugin framework added, which can be used to extend Traverso's functionality,
	  without having access to the core code!
	* Updated resourcesmanager, added Resources Bin view, with integrated File Viewer, which 
	  both support Drag and Drop to the Sheet
	* Template export for both Sheets and Project as a whole, create new Sheets or Projects
	  from a template...
	* Driver support for PortAudio was added
	* New commands (like [ X ] for 'animated' split), and improvements on existing commmands
	* autoscroll 'move' actions when near the edge of the view.
	* Reduced memory footprint
	* AudioClips reflect gain curves.
	* Port to Microsoft Windows.
	* Many options added, which can be changed in an easy to use Settings Dialog
	* CD burning added, using cdrdao to burn the exported Project
	* Many usability improvements
	* Ported the SongView and related classes to QGraphicsView (Majore change!)
	* Major GUI refresh!
	* Traverso is fully themeable now.
	* Added HistoryView Widget, depends on QUndo framework
	* Created Plugin 'framework'.
	* LV2 plugin support has been added, using the Plugin 'framework'
	* Created AddRemove Command. This command wil be used by ALL
	  "Audio Processing Objects". The objects are added/removed directly
	  if the associated Song isn't running, else it's using Tsar's thread
	  save add/remove functionality.
	  The command (of course) also provides un/redo support!
	* Added a MenuBar to please non-guru users ;-)
	* Peak class 'rewrite' (again).
	  Now peaks for all zoom levels are stored on hard disk, and ONLY loaded
	  when needed, no pre-buffering anymore (which save a HUGE amount of runtime
	  memory).
	  Peak files have a header with version information, and seek offsets to quickly
	  seek to the correct zoomlevel.
	  Normalization levels are stored in the peak file, as to quickly calculate the 
	  normalization factor for a certain range (results in instantanious normalization
	  calculation !)
	* (Re)Added visual cursor feedback on Hold Actions. 
	* Many more things I can't remember.....

16-06-2006 Remon Sijrier <remon@vt.shuis.tudelft.nl>
	* Released 0.30.0-rc1
	
	* Fixed a memory corruption bug which caused the computer to halt when the Jack driver
	  was running on Project export.
	* Fixed bug where audioclip edges were set at the wrong position on AudioClip split.

	  where it should not.
	* Correctly calculate the Song render start and end frame.
	* Added (de)normalization for AudioClips

23-05-2006 Remon Sijrier <remon@vt.shuis.tudelft.nl>
	* Released 0.29.0
	
	All changes below are from the fork until the release of 0.29.0
	
	* Fully seperated the GUI from the core code. Core code is a library, named libtraversocore
	* Ported to Qt4, no Qt3 Support is needed.
	* The application links statically to libtraversocore, and has all resource files compiled in,
		so no install is needed (makes testing builds much more comfortable)
	* Reimplemented the audio rendering, and driver backends. 
		This means: 
		- Support for Jack, and much better support for ALSA.
		- Normalized bitdepth (32 bit float), making bitdepth transparent throughout the application.
		- Using libsndfile for audio reading/writing, resulting in much more stable audio file
			read/writes and more audio formats are supported transparently, including FLAC
		- Audio file read/writes are decoupled from the audio thread with lockless ringbuffers
			greatly improving (soft) realtime behaviour.
	* Fade In/Out improved. Fade's are Curves now, with a number of presets.
	* Removed hard coded "Keyboard Shortcuts" code, replaced with scripting functionallity provided
		by Qt. Key shortcuts are stored in an xml file now, and can be reloaded at runtime!
	* Project rendering improved due use of libsndfile. Export to a number of audio formats, including 
		samplerate conversion is possible.
	* Runtime switching to Jack/ALSA/Null driver supported, including setting a new samplerate and/or 
		latency. It's inavitable that changing the driver or driver parameters will cause a short
		sound drop in case the application is playing/recording.
	* History implemented (a.k.a. Un/Redo).
	* Contextual Menu's.
	* Drag and Drop Audiofiles into any Track, or manually Import audiofiles.
	* Audio Waveform drawing improved, 2 modes are possible, "Classic View" and "Rectified View".
	* Improved "Help" Dialog, with a short introduction on how to use the application.
	* Indication of total CPU _time_ spend in both the audio thread and hard disk I/O thread.
	* Massive code cleaning, and adoption of one coding style.
	* Better Object Oriented Design, better information encapsulation using Qt signal/slot feature.
	* More "minor" things I don't remember ;-)
		

2005-09-13 Remon Sijrier <remon@vt.shuis.tudelft.nl>
	The author of the Protux/libmustux project decided to cancel my participation in the mustux project. 
	 
	I decided to fork the project, any help is of course welcome :-)
